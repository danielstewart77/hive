"""Design sessions: the three-page specification surface a Mind fills in.

A design session is the durable record of one piece of design work — the
requirements as the Mind understands them, the tests it proposes against
named functions, and the call graph of what it intends to change. Daniel
edits the text and asks questions in place; the Mind answers by publishing
a revision.

It outlives the conversation that created it. The conversation is a pointer
on the record, not its owner, so a rotation at two in the morning leaves the
work intact and the next claim re-points it.

Three rules shape everything here.

**Items are addressed by a stable id, never by their number.** Inserting a
requirement between two others must not renumber the ones below it: the
numbers are a display order, and feedback keyed to a number would silently
reattach itself to a different requirement the moment one was inserted.

**A revision may only change what Daniel touched, and only on page one.**
He reads page one as an agreement, so a Mind quietly rewording a
requirement he already accepted is the one failure that makes the whole
surface untrustworthy. It scopes to page one because his edit to a
requirement is exactly what marks the later pages stale, and those rows
carry no feedback of their own — enforcing it there would freeze a stale
page with no way back.

**A refusal is loud.** A publish that tries to rewrite a protected item, or
a save carrying a revision that has since moved, fails and says which items
or which revision. Silently keeping the older value and reporting success
is how two browser tabs quietly delete each other's work.
