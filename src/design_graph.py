"""Trimming a call graph down to the part of it Daniel is being asked about.

Page three answers one question: what is changing, and what does it sit
between. Followed all the way up, a call chain in this hive ends at a
uvicorn worker or a bash hook, which tells a reader nothing; followed all
the way down it ends in the standard library. So the page carries every
function being added or modified, one unchanged function above each place
the chain starts, and one unchanged function below each place it ends.

Two things the naive reading of that rule gets wrong.

A real entry point often has **no caller in the repository at all** — a
FastAPI route handler, a hook script, a `main`. "Exactly one caller above"
cannot be satisfied there, and a page that invents one is worse than a page
that shows none. So it is *at most* one, and its absence is reported rather
than filled.

Where several unchanged callers exist, the graph does not say which one
matters — the mind does, and it says so by the order it lists them in. The
trim takes the first and carries no more, which is what keeps a five-function
change at seven rows instead of thirty.
